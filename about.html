          <h3>Hi, I'm Andrew. I'm an Illustrator from Wellington.</h3>
            
          <p>
Andrew James is a Wellington-based artist, illustrator, writer and educator. He usually has a pen in one hand and a sketchbook in the other.</p>

<p>He started drawing to record a long trip, but that turned into keeping a record of his whole life in sketchbooks and led to an obsession with all kinds of drawing.</p>
<p>Previously a communications meteorologist at MetService and a high school mathematics teacher, his science and education background lets him make complex ideas understandable with words and pictures.</p>
<p>Enjoying the serious as well as the silly, Andrew's career highlights working with Scion researchers on a comic about the smell of possum butts and travelling to Poland to teach at the Urban Sketchers global symposium.
